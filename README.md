# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
 ## Author
 Ashton Partridge
 ## Game Concept
 In this RPG world you have the choice between 4 classes all with unique stats. Each character seeks to achieve their goals of becoming more powerful and richer than they ever were before. How they reach their goal is up to the player.
 ## Design Choices
 I chose my current stat formula because it allows power growth that won't get too out of control and will be easy to balance. I also chose the EXP formula I did because it again allows for nicely controlled and constant growth.
 ## Bonus Creative Features
 The bonus features I've added for this project are the Backstory creator that picks the backstory that matches the character class, and the EXP system that allows for more controlled player leveling.
 ## AI Usage
